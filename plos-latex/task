Table absolute MSE
proportion of time samples Phat is better than Abar





subgroup mean different than population mean
after low-rank , still different
like figure 6
on two selections: subgroup different means
					subgroup similar means

hierarchy clustering on e-vectors
scatter plot?
we show the first 2 dim
see the clear distinction of the 2 hemispher as conveyed in the 2nd dimension
researchers are interested in the other hypothesis structure in other subspace, you could try to visualize these with this method.
