Table absolute MSE
proportion of time samples Phat is better than Abar





subgroup mean different than population mean
after low-rank , still different
like figure 6
on two selections: subgroup different means
					subgroup similar means

hierarchy clustering on e-vectors
scatter plot?
we show the first 2 dim
see the clear distinction of the 2 hemispher as conveyed in the 2nd dimension
researchers are interested in the other hypothesis structure in other subspace, you could try to visualize these with this method.

switch algo 1 & algo 2
algo 1 is a subalgrotihm
Section 3.2
To summarize our overall strategy is algorithm 2
the key component is the low-rank estimator
The vital step of this algorithm is the actual low-rank approximation computation, see algorithm 1

inner product to transpose


be more specific, tau_i and tau_j

by the LLN

from that result (which result?)

effective minimum, 	a small number of blocks

simulations focus on the rank-2 setting primarily for interpretability

do 454 for M=1
