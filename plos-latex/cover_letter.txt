Dear PLOS Computational Biology,

We submit to you our manuscript titled, “Law of Large Graphs”, for publication as a research article.

As neuroscientists, computational biologists, and social scientists estimate increasingly large networks, accurate methods to estimate the mean network (or graph) becomes more important. 
When confronting high dimensional data, even accurately estimating the mean can require careful statistical thinking.
With graph data, the number of parameters for the mean of a population of graphs scales quadratically with the number of vertices and so using the standard sample mean of the adjacency matrices may be suboptimal.
The performance can be especially poor in cases with small samples sizes and a large number of vertices.
Additionally, even if the number of networks collected in a study is large, researchers will often seek to estimate the mean for smaller subsets of interest. 
Our goal is to propose a method which will improve the performance for this estimation task in these cases.


We proposed a novel method motivated by a low-rank statistical model for random networks.  We show that this end-to-end method for estimating the mean of a collection of graphs  yields improvements over using standard methods, especially when considering small cohorts, as is common practice in clinical studies. 
These methods offer major improvements in the increasingly common setting where the number of vertices in the graph is large but the number of graphs in the sample is relatively small.
We believe scientists in a variety of fields will find these methods useful when confronted with collections graphs and our associated analysis will help practitioners decide on the best estimator for their setting.
We hope you enjoy reading the manuscript and look forward to your feedback.

Best,

Daniel Sussman, on behalf of my co-authors.
